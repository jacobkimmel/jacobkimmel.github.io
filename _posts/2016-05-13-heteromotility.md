Heteromotility is a tool for analyzing cell motility in a quantitative manner. Heteromotility takes timelapse imaging data as input and calculates various 'motility features' that can be used to generate a 'motility fingerprint' for a given cell. The tool contains basic image segmentation and cell tracking components, but can also be used to analyze cell trajectories derived from another software tool. By analyzing more features of cell motility than most common cell tracking methods, Heteromotility may be able to identify novel heterogenous motility phenotypes.

## Features

* Cell tracking from timelapse imaging data with low temporal resolution
* Cell speed, distance, linearity, progressivity, time spent moving features
* Features derived from comparison of cell movement to random walk models
* Visualization of cell paths relative to a comparable random walk


## Workflow & Usage

Usage details coming soon!
