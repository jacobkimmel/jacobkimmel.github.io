## Hi, I'm Jacob

I'm currently in the Developmental & Stem Cell Biology PhD program at UC San Francisco. I'm studying aging and cellular decision making with a systems approach in the [Brack](http://bracklab.com) and [Marshall](http://biochemistry2.ucsf.edu/labs/marshall/index.html) labs.

When Iâ€™m not doing science, I like to write poorly, climb big hills, and play several instruments with equitable levels of mediocrity.

If you ever want to get in touch with me, shoot me an email at [jacob@jckimmel.me](mailto:jacob@jckimmel.me) or find me on Twitter @jacobkimmel.
