## Hi, I'm Jacob

I'm currently a Data Scientist at [Calico](http://calicolabs.com) where I work on the biology of aging. My recent research has focused on [how aging manifests differently among diverse mammalian cell types]({{site.url}}/murine_cell_aging) and developing methods for timelapse imaging and single cell RNA sequencing.

I previously earned my PhD at the [University of California San Francisco](https://ucsf.edu) in the [Laboratory of Cell Geometry](https://cellgeometry.ucsf.edu) as part of the NSF [Center for Cellular Construction](https://ccc.ucsf.edu), advised by [Wallace Marshall](http://tetrad.ucsf.edu/faculty/wallace-wallace) and [Andrew Brack](http://bracklab.com). My thesis work developed methods to infer how cell states change over time from timelapse imaging data. This approach allowed me to measure the rate of muscle stem cell activation for the first time and helped reveal age-related changes in muscle stem cells.

When Iâ€™m not doing science, I like to write poorly, climb big hills, and play several instruments with equitable levels of mediocrity.

If you ever want to get in touch with me, shoot me an email at [jacobkimmel@gmail.com](mailto:jacobkimmel@gmail.com) or find me on Twitter [@jacobkimmel](https://twitter.com/jacobkimmel).
