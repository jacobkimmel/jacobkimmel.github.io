## Hi, I'm Jacob

I'm currently a PhD Candidate in the Developmental & Stem Cell Biology program at UC San Francisco. I study muscle stem cell function using quantitative imaging in the [Brack](http://bracklab.com) and [Marshall](http://biochemistry2.ucsf.edu/labs/marshall/index.html) labs.

When Iâ€™m not doing science, I like to write poorly, climb big hills, and play several instruments with equitable levels of mediocrity.

If you ever want to get in touch with me, shoot me an email at [jacobkimmel@gmail.com](mailto:jacobkimmel@gmail.com) or find me on Twitter @jacobkimmel.
