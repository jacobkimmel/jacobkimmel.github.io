## Hi, I'm Jacob

I lead a research program as a Computational Fellow at [Calico](http://calicolabs.com) combining computational and experimental biology to address aging. Our recent work has focused on repurposing developmental programs to [restore youthful gene expression in old cells](https://reprog.research.calicolabs.com/).

Previously, I worked as a Data Scientist in [Calico's Computing group.](https://www.calicolabs.com/team/computational-scientists/)
My recent research has focused on explaining [how aging manifests differently among diverse mammalian cell types](https://mca.research.calicolabs.com), [how stem cells age](https://myo.research.calicolabs.com), and on developing methods for timelapse imaging and [single cell RNA sequencing.](https://github.com/scnym)

Prior to Calico, I earned a PhD at the [University of California San Francisco](https://ucsf.edu) as part of the NSF [Center for Cellular Construction](https://ccc.ucsf.edu), advised by [Wallace Marshall](http://tetrad.ucsf.edu/faculty/wallace-wallace) and [Andrew Brack](http://bracklab.com).
My thesis work developed methods to infer how cell states change over time from timelapse imaging data.
This approach allowed me to measure the rate of muscle stem cell activation and [helped reveal age-related changes in muscle stem cells.]({{site.url}}/aging_musc_dynamics)

When Iâ€™m not doing science, I like to write, climb big hills, and play several instruments with equitable levels of mediocrity.

If you ever want to get in touch with me, shoot me an email at [jacob@jck.bio](mailto:jacob@jck.bio) or find me on Twitter [@jacobkimmel](https://twitter.com/jacobkimmel).
I enjoy meeting new people to discuss aging biology, machine learning, carbon capture, and the relative merits of San Francisco coffee shops.
